"""
    Testing a complete worst scenario of a user :
     * Home page : wrong endpoint (/home') doesn't exist.
     * Login : with unknown email
     * book for a unknown competition
     * purchase places :
            * past competition
            * more than 12 places,
            * more than competition's places, (book 12 places, this competition has 8)
            * more than club's points,

     * got to see display board with empty data
     * Logout successfully ;)

    data used for this test :
        Mostly :
        club = Basic lift, 15 points
        competition = Aka League, date [2023-02-05 10:00:00], 20 places.
